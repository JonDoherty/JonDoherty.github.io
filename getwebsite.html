		<h1>How To Get A Website
		</h1>
		<p>
		You can get yourself a website by contacting me through e-mail. On the e-mail please tell me the topic, what you want on it and how many pages it will be. With that information I will be able to tell you an estimated price and once you agree, I will start on the website.</p>
		</p>
		<p>You can have me put some of my own words on the website or just tell me word by word what will be on the website which will lower the price.
